assimilated? qué assimilated,
brother, yo soy asimilao,
así mi la o sí es verdad
tengo un lado asimilao,
you see, they went deep....Ass
oh........they went deeper...SEE
oh, oh,...they went deeper...ME
but the sound LAO was too black
for LATED, LAO could not be
translated, assimilated,
no, asimilao, melao, 
it became a black
spanish word but
we do have asimilados
perfumados and by the
last count even they
were becoming asimilao
how can it be analyzed
as american? así que se
chavaron
trataron
pero no
pudieron
con el AO
de la palabra
principal, dénles gracias a los prietos
que cambiaron asimilado al popular asimilao.
